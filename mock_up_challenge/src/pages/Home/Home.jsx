            Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be
            destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no
            escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo,

            direction. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have
            you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions.
            Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If
            this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear
            this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the
            Ambassador. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I

            after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around.
